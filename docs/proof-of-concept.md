# Proof-of-concept delivery and evidence

This tracks implementation of [the plan](../plan/implementation.md), not a
replacement specification. Unchecked items are not implemented or verified.
The end-to-end proof must use real transports and the encrypted store, not
only mocked component tests. Tests use synthetic credentials and local origins.

## Completion checklist

- [ ] W0: Git-managed workspace, documented crates, toolchain, CI and dependency checks.
- [ ] W1: Strict contracts, session binding, policy, expiry/revocation and operation deduplication.
- [ ] W2: Pluggable store and actual SQLCipher encryption, versions, lock, wrong-key rejection, backup/rekey and restart checks.
- [ ] W3: Two provider profiles, verified TLS, final key injection, bounded response streaming and safe observation.
- [ ] W4: Standalone daemon, distinct session/control sockets, client, quotas, cancellation, configuration validation/reload and shutdown.
- [ ] W5: MCP discovery, fake credentials, status/logout and constrained HTTP tools.
- [ ] W6: Intercepted TLS, form/JSON substitution, private cookies, CSRF, response sanitization and a complete authenticated website flow.
- [ ] W7: Observation export with gaps/resume/required mode; MCP mediation and constrained TCP relay.
- [ ] W8: Trusted embedding and external client examples, operator instructions, real confinement checks and complete local verification.
- [ ] W9: Direct macOS Keychain adapter and existing-item enrollment; identify macOS-only validation.

HTTP/2, WebSocket, cross-origin federation, additional site adapters, OAuth
interactive enrollment and human approval are declared individually rather than
silently passed through. Unsupported traffic must fail explicitly. The first
supported form login, provider path, MCP and TCP coverage are required; replacing
them with a generic request example does not complete this proof.

## Implementation choices

- Start with the installed Rust 1.95 toolchain; declare Rust 1.88 compatibility
  and verify it before completion.
- Keep dependencies scoped; no `secrecy`, ORM, or general plugin system.
- Use `security-framework` directly for Keychain. Narrow low-level bindings may
  supplement it; a Swift bridge is not necessary.
- Do not modify Goose or Loupe. Their integration seams remain research inputs.
- Native macOS runtime checks may remain explicitly unverified on this Linux host.
- Leave product/license/production enrollment questions for the final handoff.
- Catalog metadata lives in private versioned JSON, separate from credentials:
  user-owned `0700` directories and `0600` files, safe descriptor-based opening,
  private atomic writes, and rejection of unsafe modes, links, and ownership.
- Preserve asynchronous operation approval separately from store unlock.
  Global/session, item, and action requirements combine restrictively. Signing
  and UI are later adapters; approval-required requests fail closed without one.

## Evidence log

W0 foundation: the three initial contract crates build and their empty test
suites run under Rust 1.95.0. Crates are added as their implementation begins.
CI describes format/check/test/lint/doc and MSRV gates; remote CI has not run.
No behavioral or security claim is verified by the scaffold.

This host's Rustup installation is read-only. Local commands use
`RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=stable`, whose installed compiler is exactly the pinned
1.95.0 version. This is a local invocation override, not a changed toolchain
requirement or an unverified claim that another compiler passed.

Core test-first checks: ID canonicalization, duplicate JSON members at every
depth, and special-purpose destination rejection failed against their initial
implementations before being implemented. Random-ID and authority-field rejection
tests likewise failed first. All five checks now pass on Rust 1.95.0, alongside
workspace check and Clippy. The async service and credential-free DTOs are
defined; the engine that enforces their complete contract is still pending.

Planning continuation, 2026-09-22: added proposed
[catalog](../plan/catalog.md), [approval](../plan/approval.md), and
[first-proof scope](../plan/proof-of-concept.md) contracts. The catalog now
specifies a paired `configuration_revision`; draft Rust types still need to
implement that contract. These documents do not complete an implementation
milestone.

Read-only verification of the existing work in progress: workspace compilation
passes under Rust 1.95.0. The five completed core tests pass; five additional
policy tests fail against unfinished catalog/target/approval stubs. Formatting
checks also report those draft Rust files. No Rust source was changed during
this planning continuation, and no commit was made with these checks failing.
The catalog JSON example parses, relative document links resolve, and the
planning diff has no whitespace errors.

Policy implementation: the unfinished catalog/target/approval stubs are now
implemented. The typed catalog carries the configuration revision, validates
store/profile/item bindings, and rejects mismatched revisions. Exact route,
header, complete-DNS-result, form-profile, and restrictive approval checks were
verified red against their initial implementations and then green. All 15
current unit tests pass, as do workspace format/check/Clippy. Session binding,
the configuration-file loader, approval execution, and store access remain
separate pending implementation work; W1 is not complete yet.

Store contract: object-safe asynchronous read/use and separate administrative
interfaces now exist, with bounded non-printable secret bytes, coherent field
snapshots, opaque item revisions, and store-access generations. Three new
behavior tests were verified failing before implementation and now pass;
a compile-fail doctest checks that secret debug formatting is unavailable.
Workspace format/check/test/Clippy pass (18 unit tests and one doctest).
No real backend behavior is established by these contract tests.
